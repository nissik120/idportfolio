            <h3>Project Brief</h3>

            <p>Project Name: The Better Service Strategy</p>
            <p>Project Overview: This scenario-based eLearning concept project is designed to help servers (waiters and waitresses) give customers the best service. The course aims to engage the learners in practical situations and subsequently learn actions that lead to positive reviews.</p>
            <p>Audience: Waiters and waitresses at Kudya Cafe</p>
            <p>Responsibilities: Instructional Design, Storyboarding, eLearning Development, Visual Design</p>
            <p>Tools Used: Draw.io, Mindmeister </p>
            <p>KPI: Achieve a four-star plus review rating within 6 months.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Kudya Cafe prides itself on quality food paired with remarkable service. The cafe is designed to cater to the occasional foodie and those desiring to work away from home and office. It also caters to those needing a getaway space in nature and those desiring to have long conversations over a meal.
            The client noticed a decrease in customer ratings. The written reviews pointed to poor quality of service, explicitly long waiting times, and a lack of attentive waiting staff. This coincided with a batch of staff recently hired to replace veteran staff. The client understands the need to act fast to repair the reputation as more Cafes gain a reputation and a steady client base.</p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Upon considering all aspects of the problem, a lack of knowledge about the identity and culture of the Cafe was seen to be the cause. To address this problem, I suggested an interactive scenario-based eLearning experience addressing the conduct of the serving staff concerning the diverse needs of the Kudya Cafe customers.
            The eLearning experience would help the serving staff offer the customers the best service that upholds the values of Kudya Cafe.</p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>For this project, I considered myself as the SME and used my experience at the Cafe to identify potential problem areas. Using ADDIE, I then developed learning outcomes for the training.</p>

            <h4>Action Map</h4>
            <p>The action map below focuses on positive actions that serving staff are supposed to consider at various points of the serving process. The serving process starts from the reception of customers, place allocation, meal serving, and seeing them off. Each step therefore requires to be carefully considered.</p>

            <h4>Text-Based Storyboard</h4>
            <p>The storyboards were designed to create a demo scenario where users learn the art of serving in a cafe scenario that fits the model Kudza operates by. These can be found at the end of the document.</p>
